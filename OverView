The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a type of model architecture that applies Transformer mechanisms—originally designed for natural language processing—to visual data. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which work directly with pixel values, ViT treats image patches as tokens similar to words in NLP tasks. Here’s a more detailed explanation and implementation of how a Vision Transformer works, including the steps you've mentioned.

Overview of Vision Transformer (ViT)
Image Patching:

An image is divided into non-overlapping patches, which are then linearly embedded into vectors.
Position Embeddings:

Since Transformers are permutation-invariant, positional embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain spatial information.
Transformer Encoder:

The embedded patches (with positional encodings) are fed into a stack of Transformer encoder layers.
Classification Head:

The output from the Transformer encoder is typically used for classification or other tasks.
Detailed Implementation Steps
Patching the Image:

Divide the image into patches.
Flatten and linearly embed each patch into a fixed-size vector.
Adding Position Embeddings:

Generate position embeddings for each patch position.
Add these embeddings to the patch embeddings.
Applying Transformer Encoder:

Pass the patch embeddings through multiple layers of the Transformer encoder.
Classification:

Use the final output (often the embedding of the [CLS] token) for classification or other downstream tasks.
